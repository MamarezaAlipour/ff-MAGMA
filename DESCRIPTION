Description: ff-MAGMA is an extension of the fields package, which is freely available on CRAN 
  and is used for spatial statistics and analyzing spatial data.  The mKrig and 
  mKrig.MLE functions from fields are reorganized to be able to use newly provided
  covariance functions that avoid recomputing the distance matrix and only compute 
  the upper triangle for symmetric covariance matrices when possible.  This package
  also supports the use of the freely available and open source MAGMA library for 
  using GPUs in addition to multi-core CPUs.  MAGMA must be installed on your computer 
  and it must be linked along with its prerequesite libraries in your ~/.R/Makevars 
  file. Development
 of this package was supported in part by the National Science Foundation  Grant
 1417857 and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
